Text Summarization project

Text summarization is the process of creating shorter text without
removing the semantic structure of text.

Now-a-days we have too many lines of text data in any form, such as
from articles or magazines or on social media.

We have time scarcity so we want only a short report of that text.

We can summarize our text in a few lines by removing unimportant
text and converting the same text into smaller semantic text form.

In this approach we build algorithms or programs which will reduce
the text size and create a summary of our text data.

This is called automatic text summarization in machine learning.
